Create your own:
- Add your assets to the `assets/` folder
- reference pictures and videos (TikTok and YT supported) in arrays: `artPlaneOptsList` and `videoPlaneOptsList`
- create audio guides and reference files in array: `audioOptsList` with a pointer to the parent art piece it is attached to
- choose a background color or use the animated skybox:
```
const animatedSkybox = false
const color = gray
```
